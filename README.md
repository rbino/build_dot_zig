# A `build.zig` compiler for Mix

This package aims to be similar to [`elixir_make`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir_make) (from
which it takes lots of inspiration) but for projects based on Zig as a build system, instead of
Make.

## Usage

The package can be installed by adding `build_dot_zig` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:build_dot_zig, "~> 0.5.0", runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

Still in your `mix.exs` file, you will need to add `:build_dot_zig` to your list of compilers in
`project/0`:

```
compilers: [:build_dot_zig] ++ Mix.compilers(),
```

If you're starting a new C NIF from scratch, you can use the Mix generator to bootstrap it. Run:

```console
mix help build_dot_zig.gen.c_nif
```

to read the documentation of the generator. You can also use the output of the generator as
inspiration to replace an existing build system for a NIF with the Zig build system.

The appropriate `zig` binary will be automatically downloaded and used to run the `build.zig`
builder.

For more information about what you can do with the Zig build system, read the [Zig build system
guide](https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system).
